## Purpose

To present a **product strategy** for DeepJudge’s next growth stage:
from a **retrieval-based knowledge system** to a **trusted, agentic workflow platform**.
This work translates DeepJudge’s technological achievements and market position into a clear operating plan that bridges product, engineering, and partnership execution with Thomson Reuters.

-----

## Why this matters

This deck shows how I think, lead, and deliver.
It reflects ten years of building platforms where **trust, compliance, and performance** define success.
It is a work sample based on public data as a proposal for DeepJudge’s evolution into the **defining infrastructure for legal AI**, a system that unites retrieval, reasoning, and workflow automation with enterprise-grade governance.

-----

## What Sets This Work Apart

  * **Layered Platform Blueprint:** Maps DeepJudge’s L1–L3 evolution (Search → Assistant → AI Workflows) into a coherent architecture and execution timeline.
  * **Strategic Symbiosis:** Frames the Thomson Reuters partnership as a growth accelerator while preserving DeepJudge’s independence and data-governance moat.
  * **Founder-Level Alignment:** Speaks the language of AI research and product delivery with equal fluency, designed for the CTO who values rigor and the CEO who values clarity.
  * **Execution Roadmap:** Defines a 90-day and 12-month plan for Layer 3 builder enablement, market feedback loops, and workflow adoption metrics.
  * **Trust as Product:** Extends the “Fort Knox” architecture into permission-aware workflow automation, anchoring DeepJudge’s long-term defensibility.

-----

## Who this is for

  * **DeepJudge Founders and Leadership** Paulina Grnarova, Yannic Kilcher, Kevin Roth.
  * **Product and Engineering Leads** defining the L3 Workflows platform.
  * **Strategic Partners** such as Thomson Reuters and early builder-law firms (Gunderson Dettmer, Homburger).
  * **Investors and Advisors** seeking a clear view of DeepJudge’s platform trajectory.

## How to review

1.  **Slides 1–11: The Strategic Thesis:** Purpose, market context, the "Knowledge Layer" thesis, founder pedigree, market validation, and the Thomson Reuters catalyst.
2.  **Slides 12–21: Product & Technology Deep Dive:** The L1-L3 platform architecture, core "Hybrid Retrieval" mechanics, and "Fort Knox" security model.
3.  **Slides 22–27: The PM Role & Core Challenge:** Defines the "PaaS PM" mandate, success metrics, and the "Dual-Persona" / "Dual-Stakeholder" challenges.
4.  **Slides 28–35: Candidate Fit & Verifiable Experience:** My specific, fact-checked experience from Vorwerk and V-Zug mapped directly to the role's challenges.
5.  **Slides 36–43: Roadmap & Closing Argument:** The 90-Day Plan, 12-Month Vision, Dual-Monetization Model, and final summary.
