## Purpose

To present a **product strategy** for DeepJudge’s next growth stage:
from a **retrieval-based knowledge system** to a **trusted, agentic workflow platform**.
This work translates DeepJudge’s technological achievements and market position into a clear operating plan that bridges product, engineering, and partnership execution with Thomson Reuters.

---

## Why this matters

This deck shows how I think, lead, and deliver.
It reflects ten years of building platforms where **trust, compliance, and performance** define success.
It is a work sample based on public data as a proposal for DeepJudge’s evolution into the **defining infrastructure for legal AI**, a system that unites retrieval, reasoning, and workflow automation with enterprise-grade governance.

## What Sets This Work Apart

* **Layered Platform Blueprint:** Maps DeepJudge’s L1–L3 evolution (Search → Assistant → AI Workflows) into a coherent architecture and execution timeline.
* **Strategic Symbiosis:** Frames the Thomson Reuters partnership as a growth accelerator while preserving DeepJudge’s independence and data-governance moat.
* **Founder-Level Alignment:** Speaks the language of AI research and product delivery with equal fluency, designed for the CTO who values rigor and the CEO who values clarity.
* **Execution Roadmap:** Defines a 90-day and 12-month plan for Layer 3 builder enablement, market feedback loops, and workflow adoption metrics.
* **Trust as Product:** Extends the “Fort Knox” architecture into permission-aware workflow automation, anchoring DeepJudge’s long-term defensibility.

---

## Who this is for

* **DeepJudge Founders and Leadership** Paulina Grnarova, Yannic Kilcher, Kevin Roth.
* **Product and Engineering Leads** defining the L3 Workflows platform.
* **Strategic Partners** such as Thomson Reuters and early builder-law firms (Gunderson Dettmer, Homburger).
* **Investors and Advisors** seeking a clear view of DeepJudge’s platform trajectory.
